# BigRock
BigRock is a 3D realtime terrain polygonization library written in C++ and designed to be engine-agnostic.
## Using BigRock
(WIP: This section will be expanded later on for more languages and engines)<br><br>
BigRock is intended to be included directly in code. This makes it easy to insert BigRock into a custom engine or to write a plugin for a proprietary engine, like Unity.
### For C++ Projects
1. Open command line on your system
2. `cd` to your project's directory
3. `clone` the repository somewhere in your project directory (e.g. `thirdparty/bigrock`)
4. `#include` the headers you need
